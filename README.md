# Home-Lab
#### This lab was created to simulate a comprehensive network environment, compiled of Windows Server 2022, a Windows user, Kali Linux and Metasploitable. Goal of remediating identified vulnerabilities in order to strengthen security.

### Setup 

Router -> Physical Host Running Windows 10 -> 4 VMs running through Oracle Virtual Box.
